# Guide 12: Troubleshooting

## Introduction

This guide helps you **diagnose and fix common issues** you may encounter while using this setup. Issues are organized by symptom for quick reference.

---

## Part 1: Installation Issues

### Issue: "Command not found: claude"

**Symptom**: Running `claude` in terminal shows command not found.

**Causes**:
1. Claude Code not installed
2. npm global binaries not in PATH

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Check if installed
npm list -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# If not installed
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# If installed but not in PATH
npm config get prefix
# Add that path/bin to your PATH

# For bash (~/.bashrc)
export PATH="$(npm config get prefix)/bin:$PATH"

# For zsh (~/.zshrc)
export PATH="$(npm config get prefix)/bin:$PATH"

# Reload shell
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Issue: "Authentication failed"

**Symptom**: Claude Code won't authenticate with Anthropic.

**Solutions**:

1. **Re-authenticate**:
```bash
claude --logout
claude
# Follow authentication flow
```

2. **Use API key directly**:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
claude
```

3. **Check API key validity** at https://console.anthropic.com

### Issue: "Permission denied" on hooks

**Symptom**: Hooks fail with permission errors.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Make hook scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/hooks/*.js
```

---

## Part 2: Hook Issues

### Issue: Hook timeout

**Symptom**: "[HOOK TIMEOUT] hook-name exceeded limit"

**Causes**:
1. Hook script too slow
2. Network issues in hook
3. Infinite loop in hook

**Solutions**:

1. **Increase timeout** in `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "command": "scripts/hooks/slow-hook.js",
        "timeout": 60  // Increase from default
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

2. **Optimize hook script** - reduce operations
3. **Add timeout handling** in hook:
```javascript
const TIMEOUT_MS = 5000;
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify({ continue: true }));
  process.exit(1);
}, TIMEOUT_MS);
```

### Issue: Hook blocking incorrectly

**Symptom**: Valid operations are being blocked.

**Solution**:

Check the hook's blocking patterns:
```javascript
// In validate-bash-command.js
const dangerousPatterns = [
  // Review these patterns
];
```

Add exceptions for your use case or adjust patterns.

### Issue: Hooks not running

**Symptom**: Hooks don't seem to execute.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check settings.json syntax**:
```bash
# Validate JSON
python -m json.tool .claude/settings.json
```

2. **Check matcher patterns**:
```json
"matcher": "Edit|Write"  // Regex pattern
```

3. **Verify hook path**:
```bash
ls -la scripts/hooks/your-hook.js
```

---

## Part 3: Agent Issues

### Issue: Agent not found

**Symptom**: "Agent 'xxx-specialist' not found"

**Solutions**:

1. **Check agent file exists**:
```bash
ls .claude/agents/xxx-specialist.md
```

2. **Check agent name** in frontmatter:
```markdown
---
name: xxx-specialist  # Must match
---
```

### Issue: Agent giving incorrect advice

**Symptom**: Agent recommendations don't work.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check skill references** in agent file
2. **Update agent with correct patterns**
3. **Report issue** - agent may need update

### Issue: Agent delegation not happening

**Symptom**: Claude doesn't delegate when expected.

**Solutions**:

1. **Request explicitly**:
```
> Use the dataflow-specialist to help with this
```

2. **Check rules** in `.claude/rules/agents.md`
3. **Use trigger words** that match agent descriptions

---

## Part 4: Skill/Command Issues

### Issue: Command not loading skill

**Symptom**: `/db` doesn't load DataFlow context.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check command file** exists:
```bash
ls .claude/commands/db.md
```

2. **Check SKILL.md** exists:
```bash
ls .claude/skills/02-dataflow/SKILL.md
```

3. **Verify frontmatter** format in both files

### Issue: Wrong patterns loaded

**Symptom**: Claude uses outdated or incorrect patterns.

**Solutions**:

1. **Clear context**:
```
> /clear
```

2. **Reload specific skill**:
```
> /db
```

3. **Update skill files** with correct patterns

---

## Part 5: Rule Enforcement Issues

### Issue: Rule not being followed

**Symptom**: Claude ignores a rule (e.g., commits without review).

**Solutions**:

1. **Remind Claude explicitly**:
```
> Remember: security review is required before commits
```

2. **Check rule file** syntax and clarity
3. **Make rule MUST instead of SHOULD**

### Issue: Rule conflict

**Symptom**: Claude seems confused between two rules.

**Solution**:

Add priority in rule file:
```markdown
## Priority
This rule takes precedence over [other rule] when [condition].
```

---

## Part 6: Testing Issues

### Issue: "Mocking detected" warning

**Symptom**: validate-workflow flags mock usage.

**Solutions**:

1. **For Tier 1 (unit tests)**: Mocking is allowed, move to `tests/unit/`

2. **For Tier 2-3**: Replace mocks with real infrastructure:
```python
# Instead of
@patch('dataflow.create')
def test_create(mock_create):
    ...

# Use
@pytest.fixture
def db():
    return DataFlow("sqlite:///:memory:")

def test_create(db):
    # Real database
    ...
```

### Issue: Tests failing in CI but passing locally

**Symptom**: Tests work locally but fail in CI.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check database setup** in CI
2. **Verify environment variables** in CI
3. **Check for test isolation** issues
4. **Add CI-specific fixtures**

---

## Part 7: Learning System Issues

### Issue: Observations not being logged

**Symptom**: `--stats` shows zero observations.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check learning directory** exists:
```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/kailash-learning/
```

2. **Initialize manually**:
```bash
node scripts/learning/observation-logger.js --stats
```

3. **Check session hooks** are running

### Issue: Evolution not creating components

**Symptom**: `/evolve` runs but nothing evolves.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check confidence thresholds** - default is 0.85+
2. **Lower thresholds temporarily**:
```bash
node scripts/learning/instinct-evolver.js --skill-threshold 0.75
```

3. **Accumulate more observations** first

### Issue: Checkpoint restore fails

**Symptom**: Restore command doesn't work.

**Solution**:

```bash
# List available checkpoints
node scripts/learning/checkpoint-manager.js --list

# Restore specific one
node scripts/learning/checkpoint-manager.js --restore checkpoint_1706720400000
```

---

## Part 8: Performance Issues

### Issue: Claude responses are slow

**Symptom**: Long delays before responses.

**Solutions**:

1. **Reduce loaded context**:
```
> /clear
```

2. **Load only needed skills**:
```
> /db  # Instead of /sdk /db /api /ai /test all at once
```

3. **Break up large tasks**

### Issue: High token usage

**Symptom**: Hitting usage limits quickly.

**Solutions**:

1. **Be concise** in requests
2. **Use commands** to load specific context
3. **Avoid re-reading** files Claude already read
4. **Batch operations** instead of one at a time

---

## Part 9: Common Error Messages

### "workflow.execute(runtime) detected"

**Problem**: Using wrong execution pattern.

**Fix**:
```python
# Wrong
workflow.execute(runtime)

# Correct
runtime.execute(workflow.build())
```

### "Relative import detected"

**Problem**: Using relative imports.

**Fix**:
```python
# Wrong
from ..workflow import builder

# Correct
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder
```

### "Primary key must be named 'id'"

**Problem**: DataFlow model with wrong primary key.

**Fix**:
```python
@db.model
class User:
    id: int  # Must be named 'id'
    # NOT: user_id: int
```

### "NO MOCKING violation"

**Problem**: Using mocks in Tier 2-3 tests.

**Fix**: Replace mocks with real infrastructure (see Part 6).

## Part 11: Quick Diagnostic Checklist

When something isn't working:

- [ ] Is Claude Code installed? (`claude --version`)
- [ ] Are you in the right directory? (`.claude/` exists)
- [ ] Is `settings.json` valid JSON?
- [ ] Are hook scripts executable? (`chmod +x`)
- [ ] Are skill files properly formatted?
- [ ] Is the agent file correctly named?
- [ ] Have you tried `/clear` and starting fresh?
- [ ] Is your API key valid?
