# Working with Claude Code: Standard Operating Procedures

## Purpose

This document establishes the definitive operating procedures for human-AI collaboration with Claude Code. It is designed for a **multi-session, multi-worktree workflow** where:

- Each phase produces **artifacts that survive session restarts**
- Human approval is a **BLOCKING GATE**, not a suggestion
- The goal is to build a **self-sustaining system** (agents + skills) that reduces future human effort
- Fresh Claude sessions are a **feature, not a bug**

### Core Principles

#### Principle 1: Externalized Cognition

Claude has no memory between sessions. Therefore:
- **All knowledge must be externalized** into docs/* artifacts
- Each phase produces documents that feed the next phase
- Fresh sessions load context from docs/04-codegen-instructions/
- Memory lives in documents, not sessions

#### Principle 2: Hard Gates, Not Suggestions

Approval gates are BLOCKING:
- **"Do not continue until I have approved your todos"** - Claude MUST STOP
- Human types explicit approval keyword (APPROVED, REVISE, ABORT)
- Silence is NOT approval - Claude waits indefinitely
- This is a commitment device for both parties

#### Principle 3: Phase Separation Via Files

The phase structure is enforced via **file separation**:
```
instructions/templates/
├── 01a-analysis-new.md         # PHASE 1: Analysis (new project)
├── 01b-analysis-existing.md    # PHASE 1: Analysis (existing project)
├── 02-planning.md              # PHASE 2: Plans and todos
├── 03-implementation.md        # PHASE 3: Implementation loop
└── 04-validation.md            # PHASE 4: Validation
```

You cannot paste Phase 2 until Phase 1 artifacts exist. This is intentional.

#### Principle 4: Self-Sustaining Goal

The end state is a project where:
- **Agents** in `.claude/agents/project/` understand what to do
- **Skills** in `.claude/skills/project/` know how to do it
- **Docs** in `docs/00-developers/` provide full context
- **Future sessions** can work WITHOUT these instruction templates

Exit criteria: Test that agents/skills work standalone.

#### Principle 5: Fresh Sessions Are Features

Long sessions accumulate:
- Conflicting context
- Forgotten constraints
- Decision fatigue
- Compounding errors

Fresh sessions with well-documented context are MORE reliable:
- Each session starts clean
- Context is focused and curated
- Input (instruction doc) is inspectable
- Behavior is reproducible

### Why Phases Are Separate Files

**Problem**: If all phases are in one file, Claude may:
- Skip analysis and jump to implementation
- Proceed without approval
- Conflate different concerns

**Solution**: Separate template files force natural gates:
- Human must consciously decide to paste next phase
- Phase 1 artifacts MUST exist before Phase 2 makes sense
- Each phase has focused context

---

## Part 3: The docs/* Artifact Structure

### Directory Purposes

| Directory | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `docs/00-developers/` | **Final developer documentation** - "what it is", "how to use it" | Continuously updated |
| `docs/01-analysis/` | **Phase 1 artifacts** - VP, USP, AAA, platform analysis | Created once, referenced often |
| `docs/02-plans/` | **Phase 2 artifacts** - Architecture decisions, approved plans | Approval record |
| `docs/03-user-flows/` | **User journey documentation** | Reference for validation |
| `docs/04-codegen-instructions/` | **Session resume documents** - Bootstrap fresh sessions | Ephemeral, operational |

### The 00- Prefix is Significant

`docs/00-developers/` appears FIRST in directory listings because:
- Developers are the primary audience
- Implementation details (01-04) support developer needs
- The project exists to serve developers

### Session Resume Documents

`docs/04-codegen-instructions/` solves the **cold start problem**:

**Without session resume docs:**
```
Human: "Continue working on feature X"
Claude: "I have no context. What is feature X?"
[30 minutes of re-explaining]
```

**With session resume docs:**
```
Human: [Pastes docs/04-codegen-instructions/feature-x.md]
Claude: "I have full context. Continuing from step 3..."
[Immediate productive work]
```

These are **worktree-specific** and **disposable** - operational scaffolding, not permanent documentation.

---

## Part 4: Hard Approval Gates

### The Commitment Device

When instructions say **"Do not continue until I have approved your todos"**:

1. Claude presents the todo list
2. Claude STOPS and WAITS
3. Human reviews and responds with:
   - **APPROVED** - Proceed to implementation
   - **REVISE: [feedback]** - Make adjustments, re-present
   - **ABORT** - Stop work entirely

**Silence is NOT approval.** Claude does not interpret lack of response as permission to proceed.

### Why Hard Gates Matter

| Without Gates | With Gates |
|---------------|------------|
| AI jumps to coding before understanding | Analysis must complete first |
| Architectural decisions are implicit | Decisions are documented |
| Scope creep is invisible | Approved todos define scope |
| Errors compound | Errors caught at cheapest point |

### Gate Locations

| Phase Transition | Gate Requirement |
|------------------|------------------|
| Analysis → Planning | Human verifies docs/01-analysis/* exists |
| Planning → Implementation | Human types APPROVED on todo list |
| Implementation → Validation | Human pastes validation template |
| Validation → Complete | Human confirms outcome matches criteria |

---

## Part 5: Product Strategy Frameworks

These frameworks are **NOT in Claude's agents/skills** and must be explicitly invoked:

### AAA Framework (Digital Enterprise Transformation)

Every feature should align with at least one:
- **Automate**: Reduce operational costs
- **Augment**: Reduce decision-making costs
- **Amplify**: Reduce expertise costs (for scaling)

If a feature doesn't align with AAA, question whether it should be built.

### Platform Model Thinking

Analyze the solution as a platform with:
- **Producers**: Users who offer/deliver products/services
- **Consumers**: Users who consume products/services
- **Partners**: Facilitators of transactions between producers and consumers

### Network Effects (5 Behaviors)

Features must cover:
- **Accessibility**: Easy transaction completion
- **Engagement**: Useful transaction information
- **Personalization**: Curated information for intended use
- **Connection**: Connected information sources (one/two-way)
- **Collaboration**: Seamless producer-consumer work

### 80/15/5 Reusability Rule

All decisions must respect:
- **80%**: Agnostic, reusable features (core)
- **15%**: Client-specific but configurable (self-service)
- **5%**: Pure customization (requires justification)

**GATE**: If custom work exceeds 5%, STOP and escalate. This indicates wrong product-market fit or need for refactoring.

---

## Part 6: Multi-Session Workflow

### The "Spam Repeatedly" Pattern

Implementation instructions say: **"Spam this repeatedly until all todos/active have been moved to todos/completed"**

This pattern:
- Each iteration is a fresh session (no accumulated errors)
- The instruction document provides consistent context
- Progress is tracked via todo completion (externalized state)
- Human can pause, resume, or adjust between iterations

### Worktree-Specific Instructions

For parallel development:
```
docs/04-codegen-instructions/
├── 01-backend-worktree.md      # Backend terminal
├── 02-web-worktree.md          # Web frontend terminal
├── 03-mobile-worktree.md       # Mobile app terminal
└── 04-integration-guide.md     # How codebases merge
```

Each worktree has its own context document. Multiple Claude sessions can work in parallel on different worktrees.

### Context Loading for Fresh Sessions

Every session resume document must begin with:
```markdown
## Context Loading
Peruse this document and actively reference any linked docs to achieve
high situational awareness. Check todos/active/ for current state.
Then proceed with implementation.
```

---

## Part 7: Self-Sustainability Exit Criteria

### The Goal

After completing all phases, the project should have agents/skills that work **WITHOUT** these instruction templates.

### Validation Test

1. Start a fresh Claude session
2. Ask: "Using only the agents in `.claude/agents/project/` and skills in `.claude/skills/project/`, implement [new feature X]"
3. Claude should be able to:
   - Understand what to do (agents)
   - Know how to do it (skills)
   - Reference knowledge base (docs/00-developers/)

If Claude cannot complete the task without returning to instruction templates, the agents/skills are **INCOMPLETE**.

### What Self-Sustaining Looks Like

| Future Task | How It's Handled |
|-------------|------------------|
| Bug fix | Agent knows process, skill has patterns |
| New feature | Agent coordinates specialists, skills provide patterns |
| Onboarding | docs/00-developers/ provides full context |
| Architecture question | ADRs in docs/02-plans/ explain decisions |

---

## Part 8: What Humans Focus On

### Human Responsibilities

| Focus Area | Examples | When |
|------------|----------|------|
| **Objectives** | Business goals, user outcomes, success metrics | Start of project |
| **Domain Expertise** | Industry knowledge, regulatory requirements | Throughout |
| **Constraints** | Technology stack, budget, timeline, compliance | Start and adjustments |
| **Approval Gates** | APPROVED/REVISE/ABORT at phase transitions | Between phases |
| **Final Validation** | Testing against objectives, user acceptance | End of implementation |

### What Humans DON'T Do

| Don't Do | Why | Instead |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Specify implementation | Limits Claude's solution space | Describe outcomes |
| Review each file | Slows progress, reduces autonomy | Review via testing |
| Skip approval gates | Defeats quality control | Always provide explicit approval |
| Proceed without artifacts | Future sessions lose context | Ensure docs/* are created |

---

## Part 9: Template Usage Guide

### Choosing the Right Template

| Situation | Template File | Expected Duration |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Brand new project | `01a-analysis-new.md` → `02-planning.md` → `03-implementation.md` | Multi-session |
| Existing codebase | `01b-analysis-existing.md` → `02-planning.md` → ... | Multi-session |
| Single feature (project exists) | `03-implementation.md` (with approved todos) | 1-2 sessions |
| Validation only | `04-validation.md` | 1 session |

### Template Workflow

1. **Copy the template** - Don't excerpt, copy all of it
2. **Fill in HUMAN INPUT section** - This is YOUR domain
3. **Paste into Claude terminal** - Let Claude execute
4. **Wait for GATE** - Claude will stop and wait for approval
5. **Provide explicit approval** - Type APPROVED, REVISE, or ABORT
6. **Repeat for next phase** - Paste next template when ready

---

## Summary

### Key Operational Points

1. **Phases are enforced via file separation** - You can't skip phases
2. **Gates require explicit approval keywords** - Silence is not approval
3. **Artifacts survive sessions** - Memory lives in docs/*
4. **Fresh sessions load from docs/04-codegen-instructions/** - Cold start solved
5. **End goal is self-sustaining agents/skills** - Templates become unnecessary

### The Philosophy

> "A project that contains enough documented knowledge that it can be extended, maintained, and evolved by any competent developer (human or AI) without access to the original creators."

This is **autonomous maintainability** - where the project maintains itself.
